# Credit-Default-Modelling-from-Prosper-Loan-Data

This work is actually a continuation of the exploratory data analysis of the prosper loan data, which can be found in another repository of mine. In this part, I build a predictive model capable of identifying loans at high risk of default using past history of completed and defaulted loans. To get a basic familiarity with the dataset, I recommend you to visit part 1 of this work as it is an elaborate description and visualization of the dataset
